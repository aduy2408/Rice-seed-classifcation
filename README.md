##  Overview

This project implements an automated rice seed classification system that can identify and classify different varieties of rice seeds based on their morphological, color, and texture characteristics. The system extracts multiple types of features from rice seed images and uses machine learning algorithms to achieve high classification accuracy.

## Objectives

- **Automated Classification**: Classify rice seeds into different varieties without manual intervention
- **Multi-feature Analysis**: Extract comprehensive features including shape, color, texture, and geometric properties
- **High Accuracy**: Achieve reliable classification performance across multiple rice varieties
- **Scalable Solution**: Provide a framework that can be extended to new rice varieties

## Rice Varieties in Dataset

The system currently supports classification of the following rice varieties:

- **BC-15**: A high-yield variety
- **Huong Thom (Huongthom)**: Fragrant rice variety
- **Nep-87 (Nep87)**: Glutinous rice variety
- **Q-5 (Q5)**: Quality rice variety
- **Thien Uu (Thien_uu)**: Premium rice variety
- **Xi-23 (Xi23)**: Specialty rice variety
- **TBR-36**: Traditional variety
- **TBR-45**: Traditional variety
- **TH3-5**: Hybrid variety

## Feature Extraction

The system extracts multiple types of features from rice seed images:
